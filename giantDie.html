        Down below you can see some dice (if the picture was able to load).
        <br>
        On the left you can see the two pyramidical dice know as a d4 (the nomenclature is basically d+the number of
        sides) one to the right at the front you can see
        the d20 which is often the most used die, if it is used in the system. Behind the d20 you can see two d12, in my
        experience these are highly underused
        but they are still pretty cool looking. To the right of the reddish d20 there are two blue d10 with different
        "designs". One with 0-9 and the other from
        00-90. This difference is so that you can roll a d100 and since a 100 sided die is difficult to come by you take
        two d10 and declare one as the ones-digit and
        the other as the tens-digit and get your number that way. If both show a 0(or 00) it is a 100. Behind the right
        d20 you can see a reddish d8 and behind that a
        regular game dice known as a d6. As you might guess this one is used often aswell.
