            <h2>What is Pen and Paper Roleplay?</h2>
            <p>
                Pen and Paper Roleplay is a type of game genre where you normally sit around a table with other people
                and act out stories imagined by everyone together.
                If that sounds weird to you let me explain further.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                So the roleplay aspect of the game is very straightforward, you have a character and you act as if you
                were that character.
                you might be a wise wizard, a genius hacker, or just a strong warrior of any kind, regardless what your
                character
                is you give him a personality. This personality might be completely different from what you expect or
                exactly what you would think it is, but it
                is important to remember that every character is different in some way and you as a player need to act
                out these differences somehow.
                So if you play a sly thief you might feel reluctant to talk since you like the whole silent but deadly
                robber aesthetic or
                you can play that as an outgoing con artist who tricks people out of their money with clever word play.
                Since you have to act out what you want
                to do you might think one is more difficult than the other since the first one doesnt really speak, but
                fear not more often than not you will be rewarded
                by the gamemaster for clever roleplaying. What a gamemaster is will be explained later.

            <p>
                The pen and paper aspect is just representing the medium the game is played in. Imagining cool battles
                is great and all but without rules
                it would just be a power-fantasy of some friends. These games follow a system of rules which determine
                how you can interact with the world
                the gamemaster provides you with. Each system normally gives you some sort of stats which show a
                character's ability in one field of expertise and you write
                these stats down on a piece of paper with a pen -see where this is going?- Part of the rules are usually
                a set of
                dice which determine success of actions in some way. Using the rules and your imagination in
                tandem you can experience all kinds of stories and have fun with your friends or soon to be friends,
                because let's be honest here
                this game isn't your run of the mill 1 hour board game no. I would say it is at least 3 hours per
                session and you would probably play once a
                week to get the story moving forward. Yeah it is very time consuming.
            </p>

            <h3 id="Gamemaster">Gamemaster</h3>
            <p>
                So "gamemaster" what is that? Usually these kinds of games have someone who governs the world, who
                guides the players through the world, who plays
                the other people in the world. Said someone is usually known as the gamemaster. The gamemaster's "job"
                is to provide a fun narrative
                and enough improvisation skills to let the players play the game. This is an important fact about this
                genre, there are not many systems
                that don't utilize a gamemaster of some sort so if you want to play the game and have no one to master
                well then you should probably face
                the facts that you either find some one who would like to master or you learn to master yourself.

            <h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3>
            <p>
                To summarize the genre is a combination of ruled improvized acting and a pinch of luck with the dice
                rolls.
                If you take the time to set up a group and play regularly you will have lots of fun and might even
                improve on some social skills, who knows.
